# Masterthesis

This master's thesis will analyse the non-household contacts from wave 12-43 in the Belgian CoMix data.

* **Data management:** data cleaning and handling of missing values.
* **Exploratory analysis:** summarizing the data.
* **Model adults GPO:** code for the model building to model the number of non-household contacts for the adults age category via a Generalised Poisson GAMLSS model.
* **Model adults NBI:** code for the model building to model the number of non-household contacts for the adults age category via a Negative Binomial GAMLSS model.
* **Model children GPO:** code for the model building to model the number of non-household contacts for the children age category via a Generalised Poisson GAMLSS model.
* **Model children NBI:** code for the model building to model the number of non-household contacts for the children age category via a Negative Binomial GAMLSS model.
* **Model elderly GPO:** code for the model building to model the number of non-household contacts for the elderly age category via a Generalised Poisson GAMLSS model.
* **Model elderly NBI:** code for the model building to model the number of non-household contacts for the elderly age category via a Negative Binomial GAMLSS model.
* **Clustering:** code for the clustering task of this thesis:
** Make contact profiles based on locations of contacts.
** Clustering of participants based on demographic characteristics.
